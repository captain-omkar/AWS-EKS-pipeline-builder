hi this is the devops engineer, we are already building the aws cicd pipeline tool, the code is in the aws codecommit repo, there are some bugs we need to work on, so you have to clone the repo with feature branch and start the work on it, and also plese create whtever the files and folder are required to create in that folder only.

Most important, do not change the existing logic and code for any other changes.

Also Please update the the Readme.txt for everytime you add or remove someting so that you will have that idea of updated code.
